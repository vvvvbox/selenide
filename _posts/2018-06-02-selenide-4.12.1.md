Good summer!

With some delay, we post the Selenide 4.12.1 release notes.

<br>

# Fixed name of downloaded file 

When you download a file with link containing `?` and parameters (like `/download/me/selenide-4.11.5.md?sessioncookie=12345`),
Selenide created a local file with name `selenide-4.11.5.md?sessioncookie=12345`.

Now Selenide will cut all characters from `?`. In this case, it will create a file `selenide-4.11.5.md`.

# Changed implementation of method `Selenide.refresh()` 

This method sometimes didn't actually refresh the page.  
We could not reproduce it, but blindly changed the implementation - now it just calls built-in selenium method  
`webdriver.navigate().refresh()`. Seems that it fixed the problem. 
 
See [issue 740](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/740) - thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 741](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/741)

# Fixed method `WebDriverRunner.isHeadless()`

This method returned `true` only for HtmlUnit and PhantomJS.
Now it returns `true` also for Chrome/Firefox when executed in `headless` mode.

(Thought I personally don't understand why one needs to use this method.
Don't use it. Do you really need Selenide help to know what browser you have started?) 
 
See [issue 750](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/750) - thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 751](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/751)

# Added thread ID to log messages on closeWebDriver() method

For some people, it was sometimes hard to understand which thread closed the driver. Now it will be easier.

(Thought I personally don't understand why it should be a problem)
 
See [issue 582](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/582) - thanks to [Alexander Poleschuk](https://github.com/AlexanderPoleschuk) for [PR 737](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/737)

# Declared `webdrivermanager` dependency as `api`

Now you can use webdrivermanager from your code without declaring any additional dependencies.

# Migrated from `coveralls` to `sonarcloud`

for measuring Selenide own test coverage. It doesn't affect you directly, just FYI. 

See [issue 702](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/702) - thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 744](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/744)
