Dear friends,
we released Selenide 4.11.2. Below you can find the notable changes of this release. 

<br>

# Now you can make screenshots inside `iframe`

You can find examples in [ScreenshotInIframeTest](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/ScreenshotInIframeTest.java):

```java
SelenideElement iframe = $("#iframe_page");
SelenideElement element = $("#small_div");
File file = Screenshots.takeScreenShot(iframe, element);
```

Thanks to [Andrejs Kalnačs](https://github.com/andrejska) for [PR 705](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/705)

# We added method `atBottom()`

Now you can check if a page is scrolled to the bottom: 

```java
assertFalse(atBottom());
executeJavaScript("return window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);");
assertTrue(atBottom());
```

You can find examples in [PageAtBottomTest](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/PageAtBottomTest.java)

# We added setting `setValueChangeEvent`

As you probably know, methods `$.append()` and `$.setValue()` trigger few events after setting a value to the input field, including the `change` event.
We recently realized that it's wrong, because the `change` even should be triggered by browser. 

It also caused problems in some cases - for example, when this `change` event caused focus moving to the next element in 
DOM which was actually outside of viewport.

Don't panic, Selenide behaviour hasn't changed by default. Default value is `setValueChangeEvent=true`. 

If you agree with our reasoning, disable triggering `change` event via system property:

```
-Dselenide.setValueChangeEvent=false
```

or right in code:

```java
Configuration.setValueChangeEvent = false;
```

If you disagree, feel free to share your thoughts. Let's discuss it!

# We upgraded dependencies

* htmlunit:2.30
* webdrivermanager:2.2.1

If you use a custom `SLF4J` implementation, you may get some spam in logs like this:

```
SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.
SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/arasolka/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-slf4j-impl/2.11.0/9ba207b78e470fe7765ebee14f1f0336c9cbcc18/log4j-slf4j-impl-2.11.0.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]
SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/arasolka/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/ch.qos.logback/logback-classic/1.2.3/7c4f3c474fb2c041d8028740440937705ebb473a/logback-classic-1.2.3.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.
SLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.apache.logging.slf4j.Log4jLoggerFactory]
```

To remove this spam, ignore the transitive dependency of `webdrivermanager`:
```groovy
configurations.all {
    exclude group: "ch.qos.logback", module: "logback-classic"
}
```

We will fix it in next Selenide version.

## Statistics

We haven't posted Selenide download statistics for a long time.
And it is growing!
A year ago there were 8000, now 18000 downloads in a month.
