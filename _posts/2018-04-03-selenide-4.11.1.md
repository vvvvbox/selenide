Dear friends,
We recently moved to "Semantic versioning". Now Selenide versions will be called 4.11.x and released more often. 

In Selenide 4.11.1 we did only one fix:

<br>

# Fixed a problem with hanging Chrome on Windows

Windows users complained that even after calling `Selenide.close()` process `chrome.exe` still hangs in task manager.
Thought it's not a Selenide bug, we managed to tune webdriver settings, so that Chrome is properly closed now.

Thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 711](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/711)!

<br>

That's it. Selenide 4.11.2 is coming soon!
